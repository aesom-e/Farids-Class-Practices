# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Contributing to Python Practice

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository is designed to help students practice Python through structured problems with automated I/O testing. Your contributions help improve the quality and variety of problems available to learners.

## How You Can Contribute

You are welcome to contribute in the following ways:

### üìñ Improve Question Clarity
- Edit ##-##-##.md files to fix grammar, improve clarity, or enhance explanations.
- Ensure the problem statement aligns with the expected input/output behavior.

### üîç Fix Incorrect I/O Test Cases
- If you find a test case that does not match the expected output, fix it.
- Ensure corrections maintain the intended problem difficulty.

### ‚úÖ Add More Test Cases
- Add edge cases, boundary values, or off-by-one scenarios.
- Name test cases following the existing pattern:
    - ##-##-##.X-YY.in (input file)
    - ##-##-##.X-YY.out (expected output file)
    - X represents test difficulty (1 = easy, 2 = medium, etc.)
    - YY is a sequential number (01, 02, etc.).
    - Example: 01-02-01.2-03.in and 01-02-01.2-03.out.

### ‚ú® Create New Problems
- Submit a new problem following the existing folder structure (Unit-Chapter).
- Include a ##-##-##.md file with a clear description, input format, output format, and sample cases.
- Add at least 3 test cases (one sample and two additional).
- Ensure your problem is distinct from existing ones.
