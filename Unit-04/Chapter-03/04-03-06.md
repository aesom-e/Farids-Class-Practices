# Unit 4 Chapter 3 Question 6 - The One That He Removed
Create a program that takes in a string of words separated by spaces. Create a list with each of those words in order of appearance without using list comprehension. Next, use list comprehension to generate a new list where only the words that are proper nouns (capitalized) appear. Print this new list.

  You may want to consider using a method `.split()` on the input to split the string up into a list of strings, being split at whitespaces.

## Input Specification
The input will consist of a string, $K$, which contains up to 15 words. Each word is separated with a space, with some being capitalized and some not.

## Output Specification
The output will consist of the generated list, containing only the __capitalized__ words (proper nouns) from the original input string. This list should be printed exactly as a Python list (including square brackets and single quotation marks around each word, if applicable).

## Sample Input
```
I met Alice and Bob at the Park on Sunday
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
['I', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Park', 'Sunday']
```
