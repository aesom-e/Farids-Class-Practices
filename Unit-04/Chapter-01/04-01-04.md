# Unit 4 Chapter 1 Question 4 - Grant Tracker

Create a program that takes a university student’s name, their 1st parent’s income, and their second parent’s income.
If the average income between the parents is $40,000 or below, then it would put them into a Tuition Grant list.
If it’s above, then it would be a Full Tuition Required list.
Once the university admission officer has completed inputting all the students, the program will end and print out the two lists.
