# Unit 4 Chapter 1 Question 1 - Inventory Tracker

A grocery store needs to track whether their specific apple types are in stock.
Create a program that first, as the manager, takes in all the types of apples
**(loop of inputs with an exit condition of your choice)** in stock in the morning.
After, as the customer, you need to be able to search for a specific apple,
where it tells them whether itâ€™s in stock or not **(this can be in a separate loop as well)**.
