# Unit 3 Chapter 3 Question 4 - Adding Numbers Looped (hard)

Create a program that does the same as the one directly above, but randomly decides at the start whether it wants to skip the current iteration and move onto the next. It should still be counting down towards the maximum of 5 iterations, then printing `“I’m tired, goodbye”.` 
You will need to import the `random` module for this question.

Note: There is a very small chance that the program might not do anything at all and just say “I’m tired, goodbye”.
