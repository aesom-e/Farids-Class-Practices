# Unit 3 Chapter 7 Question 4 - Scaled Up Icons
You have been asked to take a small icon that appears on the screen of a smart telephone and scale it up so it looks bigger on a regular computer screen.

The icon will be encoded as characters (`x` and `*`) in a 3 x 3 grid as follows:
<br>\*x\*
<br>&nbsp;xx
<br>\*&nbsp;\*

Write a program that accepts a positive integer scaling factor and outputs the scaled icon. A scaling factor of $k$ means that each character is replaced by a $k$ X $k$ grid consisting only of that character.

## Input Specification
The input $k$ will be an integer such that 0 < $k$ â‰¤ 10.

## Output Specification
The output will be 3$k$ lines, which represent each individual line scaled by a factor of $k$ and repeated $k$ times. A line is scaled by a factor of $k$ by replacing each character in the line with $k$ copies of the character. 

## Sample Input
```
