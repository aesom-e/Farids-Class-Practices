# Unit 3 Chapter 7 Question 1 - Fibonacci Sequence
You are to create a program to find all numbers in the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTlw7fNcO-0). The first two numbers in the sequence are 1 and 1.

Remember to use proper documentation and I/O interfacing!

## Output Specification
Your program is to output all numbers in the fibonacci sequence on a seperate line up to the 25th number. Lastly, state the 24th and 25th sequence inside of a sentence, explaining how the golden ratio is conducted from it, including what it is.

Note: you donâ€™t know what the 24th and 25th numbers are, get the program to find out and calculate itself what the ratio is, do not hard-code the 24th/25th/ratio into your print statement.
