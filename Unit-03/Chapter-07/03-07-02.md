# Unit 3 Chapter 7 Question 2 - Street Fighter
Jonathan Joestar and Joseph Joestar get into a heated argument and decide to spar it out. 

Jonathan Joestar can take a hit like a champ, as he has 750 hit points, while Joseph only has 250 hit points. What Joseph lacks in tankiness, he makes up for in damage. Joseph can deal damage consistently between 60 and 90 hp. This means that Joseph can reduce Jonathanâ€™s hit points randomly between 60 and 90 hp. Jonathan can only deal between 20 and 30 hp damage. 

Create a looped game where they fight until one gets knocked out. In each round, each player only gets to attack once, but the first one to land the punch is random every round. Both players cannot be knocked out at the end of the round at the same time.

## Output Specification
Your program is to output the health of each character at the end of each round, and how much their attack dealt.
