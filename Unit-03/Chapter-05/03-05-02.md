# Unit 3 Chapter 5 Question 2 - Multiplication Table

Create a program that takes in an integer from 1-9 and prints a [multiplication table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table#Modern_times) without the row/column headers. The table does not need to be aligned, the numbers just need to be separated by a single space.

  If your program doesn't work with the I/O testing, you might have trailing spaces at the end of each line. The output has no ending spaces!
